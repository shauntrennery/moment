### Transcript

Hello there, this is Erika from 'Just a Moment News' bringing you the top news stories on this 18th day of January, 2024.

First up, we have some news from the education sector. The 2023 National Senior Certificate (NSC) exams results are in and it's quite impressive. The Independent Examinations Board (IEB) reports that nearly 99% of private school pupils in South Africa passed. This is a slight increase from the previous year's rate. However, it's worth noting that there was a slight drop in the percentage of students achieving a Bachelor's pass, while those qualifying for diploma study saw an increase. The IEB CEO, Confidence Dikgole, highlighted the challenges faced by the students, including disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic and growing mental health issues. Meanwhile, the SA Comprehensive Assessment Institute (SACAI) reported a steady 72% pass rate. 

Moving on to the world of cryptocurrency, despite China's strict ban on crypto trading since 2021, underground crypto trading seems to be thriving. Traders are using technology to mask their locations and continue trading. In fact, between July 2022 and June 2023, there were $86 billion in crypto transactions, including $90 billion in one month on Binance. However, the Chinese government continues to crack down on illegal financial flows and money laundering related to crypto.

In tech news, a German startup called Vay has launched a remotely driven car service in Las Vegas. The service involves humans remote-controlling cars from physical stations miles away. The service is currently available around the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and the Arts District. The startup has raised around $100 million from investors including former Google CFO Patrick Pichette, Kinnevik AB, and venture capital firm Atomico.

On to sports, Polish tennis player Iga Swiatek made an incredible comeback at the Australian Open. Despite being down 4-1 in the final set, she managed to win five consecutive games to clinch a 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 victory over Danielle Collins. This extends her win streak to 18.

In cybersecurity news, a researcher has uncovered one of the biggest password breaches in recent history. About 71 million unique credentials from websites like Facebook, Roblox, eBay, and Yahoo have been circulating on the internet for over four months. To ensure password safety, experts recommend adopting strong, unique passwords or passphrases, storing them in a password manager, avoiding phishing sites, keeping devices malware-free, and utilizing two-factor authentication.

Samsung has launched its new flagship Galaxy S24 series in South Africa. The devices come with significant enhancements in their AI features, collectively termed 'Galaxy AI'. Hardware improvements include flatter screens, new chipsets, significant camera upgrades, and slightly increased battery capacities. Pre-orders start today.

Finally, YouTube's biggest star, MrBeast, is testing out platform X after an invitation from Elon Musk. He reuploaded one of his popular YouTube videos, "$1 vs $100,000,000 Car!" on X to compare its performance and assess X's capacity for generating ad revenue.

And that's all for today's news. This has been Erika from 'Just a Moment News', keeping you updated. Stay tuned for more news tomorrow.
