Hello, this is Erika from 'Just a Moment News', bringing you the top stories for today, February 28, 2024. 

To kick things off, we're talking about a major shakeup in the music industry. Universal Music Group, the world's largest music company, has pulled its artists' music from TikTok due to a stalemate in contract negotiations. This has significantly impacted the release and promotion of new music on the platform, including Gwen Stefani's new song "Purple Irises," a duet with Blake Shelton. This dispute is part of a larger battle over the value of music on social media and could potentially reshape the economic landscape of music distribution on these platforms.

Next, we have a story from South Africa, where the majority of the country's white rhino population is now privately owned. This is due to the increasing threat of poaching, particularly in KwaZulu-Natal. The Private Rhino Owners’ Association reports that over 8,000 white rhinos, or about 65% of the national herd, are now under private ownership. This shift towards privatization raises questions about the sustainability of rhino populations on private lands and the future of conservation efforts in the country.

In tech news, Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, has spoken out about the controversial Gemini AI app. The app was suspended for producing offensive imagery and text, including problematic depictions and comparisons involving race. Pichai described these outcomes as unacceptable and pledged structural changes to improve the app's guardrails. This incident serves as a reminder of the technical and ethical complexities of AI development and the need for careful management of AI's societal impact.

Moving on to a more uplifting story, Cape Town entrepreneur Jo-Ash Rajcoomar has won the Sony Creators Convention 2024. His winning pitch focused on the importance of education in content creation. The convention celebrated creativity and offered workshops on brand collaborations and crafting viral content. Rajcoomar's victory underscores the significance of educational importance in the creative industry.

In legal news, the screenwriter of the 1989 action film Road House, R. Lance Hill, has filed a lawsuit against MGM Studios and Amazon Studios, alleging copyright infringement related to the remake of Road House. The lawsuit also accuses Amazon Studios of using generative AI to clone actors' voices for the remake, a move purportedly made during the Hollywood strikes of last year. Amazon MGM Studios has refuted the AI usage allegations and contested the validity of several lawsuit claims.

Next, we have an update on the ongoing legal dispute between Vodacom and Kenneth Nkosana Makate, the inventor of the Please Call Me service. Vodacom has initiated a legal challenge in the Constitutional Court against a ruling favoring Makate, demanding a compensation model that could amount to a minimum of two hundred and nine billion Rand. The case highlights complex issues surrounding intellectual property and compensation for innovative ideas within corporate South Africa.

Lastly, the Gauteng Provincial Government has launched a trial for a panic button app, designed to support up to 14,000 users. Despite a successful launch and the potential to enhance emergency response, user feedback reveals mixed experiences. The government aims to expand the user base to 100,000 and is in discussions to zero-rate the app by April 2024 to ensure wider accessibility.

And that's all for today's news. This is Erika from 'Just a Moment News', signing off. Stay informed and have a great day!
