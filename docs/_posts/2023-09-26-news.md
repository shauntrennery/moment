### Transcript

Good morning, everyone! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, and today is September 26, 2023. Let's dive into today's headlines.

First up, we have a story from Pretoria, South Africa. Two sisters, Barbara van Zyl and Christa Smith, have been arrested for allegedly stealing 137 million Rand from Premier, a major South African food and packaged goods company. As senior credit controllers, they are accused of diverting payments from a large customer into their own company between 2016 and 2020. The sisters now face up to 30 years in prison if convicted under the Prevention of Organised Crime Act. Premier is seeking to recover the funds and has filed a confidential fraud insurance claim [Image].

Moving on to New York City, where the fine-dining elite fell victim to a prank. Mehran Jalali, a 21-year-old AI startup founder, and his friends created a fake steakhouse named Mehran's Steakhouse. They managed to gather a 2,600-person waitlist and hosted a one-night event at an unmarked public bathhouse-turned-event space. While some patrons threatened legal action, others found the hoax to be a delightful and entertaining break from the city's serious food scene. It's certainly an unforgettable experience [Image].

In Stanford, a village in South Africa's Western Cape, a group of 13 people, three dogs, and a cat were stranded in an upstairs apartment for over five hours during a storm. As floodwaters rose, they broke windows and burglar bars to swim to safety. Eventually, they were rescued by lifeboats and found temporary shelter in town. It's heartening to see the strong community support in times of crisis [Image].

OpenAI has made an exciting announcement. They have launched a new version of ChatGPT, their chatbot, that now incorporates voice interaction and image recognition. This development puts ChatGPT in direct competition with voice-activated digital assistants like Alexa and Siri. Subscribers to ChatGPT Plus will be the first to receive these updates, which include the chatbot's ability to correct itself and generate responses on the fly. The image recognition feature also opens up educational possibilities [Image].

Lastly, the Western Cape in South Africa has been hit by intense storms, causing flooding, uprooted trees, and power outages. Various areas, including Cape Town, have experienced flooding, and emergency services have been working to assist affected residents. Assessments are underway to determine the extent of the damage. Road closures and traffic disruptions have also been reported. Our thoughts are with those affected by the storm [Image].

That wraps up today's news stories. Stay safe and have a great day! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, signing off.
