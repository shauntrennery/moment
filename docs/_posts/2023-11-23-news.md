### Transcript

Good morning, and welcome to Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and today is November 23, 2023. Let's dive into today's headlines.

First up, we have news about OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. After being dismissed as CEO, Sam Altman has been reinstated following his ouster. The board has also been partially reconstituted and now includes notable figures such as Bret Taylor, Larry Summers, and Adam D'Angelo. Altman's return is seen as a consolidation of his power, potentially reducing oversight. Analysts suggest that strong investor support, particularly from Microsoft, might give Altman more freedom to commercialize AI technologies. However, there are concerns about the effectiveness of the new board in overseeing Altman, raising fears of it becoming a "rubber stamp."

In related news, Altman's ouster was precipitated by a warning from staff researchers about a potentially threatening AI discovery. The warning came in the form of a letter to the board expressing concerns over the risks associated with a powerful AI algorithm. Altman's temporary removal from his position was due to the board's worries about the premature commercialization of AI advancements. The controversy centered around a project named Q*, which showed significant potential but also raised safety concerns. Altman's dismissal led to internal strife, with over 700 employees threatening to resign in solidarity with him.

Moving on, there are rumors suggesting that Jon Rahm, a professional golfer, might leave the PGA Tour for a $600 million offer from the Saudi-backed LIV Golf series. Phil Mickelson claimed that Rahm's move to LIV was a "done deal," but Rahm's interest seems to be more focused on legacy than money. Despite the rumors, Rahm hasn't confirmed any move, and his loyalty to the PGA Tour and major wins, such as the 2023 Masters, have surprised some, including Rory McIlroy. LIV's exclusion from majors and the Ryder Cup is seen as a drawback, but Mickelson anticipates more players joining LIV in the future.

In other news, a World Bank study has found that rampant crime in South Africa is costing the country at least 10% of its GDP annually. Crime affects one in five households each year, and companies face high security costs. Informal businesses, which are crucial for the economy and job creation, are particularly vulnerable to crime and often can't afford preventative measures. The study recommends that the government pass legislation to enhance the authorities' ability to prosecute high-level crimes and recruit investigative specialists.

Next, we have a story about the strange saga of a Netflix series that will never see the light of day. In 2018, filmmaker Carl Erik Rinsch pitched a sci-fi series about artificial humans and reached an informal agreement with Amazon. However, Netflix outbid Amazon, offering more money and the rare privilege of final cut to Rinsch. Netflix invested over $55 million in the project but faced significant issues due to Rinsch's erratic behavior and financial mismanagement. This led to a legal battle between Rinsch and Netflix, with Rinsch claiming breach of contract. The project's failure highlights the risks of Hollywood's high-stakes content race and the need to focus on profitability.

Lastly, we have a review of the film "Napoleon" directed by Ridley Scott and starring Joaquin Phoenix. The film offers a panoramic and invigorating depiction of Napoleon Bonaparte's life, particularly excelling in its realistic battle sequences. Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Napoleon is compelling, especially in the battle scenes. However, the film struggles to coherently link these grand moments, leaving gaps in the understanding of Napoleon's character. The focus on his relationship with Josephine oversimplifies the complex figure. Despite these narrative shortcomings, the film is visually stunning and recommended to be seen in theaters, particularly on an IMAX screen.

That's all for today's news. Thank you for joining me on Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and I'll see you next time.
