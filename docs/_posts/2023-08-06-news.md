Hello everyone, and welcome to 'Just a Moment News.' I'm Erika, and today is August 6th, 2023. Let's dive into today's headlines.

In the world of boxing, Jake Paul secured a lopsided unanimous decision win against Nate Diaz. Despite being knocked down in the fifth round, Diaz showed resilience throughout the match. The final scores were 98-91, 98-91, and 97-92 in favor of Paul. Diaz acknowledged Paul's toughness and even joked about his brief MMA moves during the boxing bout. Paul expressed interest in an MMA rematch with Diaz and hasn't ruled out a boxing rematch with Tommy Fury. Diaz, on the other hand, remains open to any fight. 

Moving on to soccer, Banyana Banyana's World Cup journey came to an end as they were defeated 2-0 by the Netherlands in the round of 16. Despite it being their debut in this stage, Banyana Banyana showcased great determination. Mistakes from Ramalepe and Swart were capitalized on by the Dutch, resulting in goals by Roord and Beerensteyn. Banyana Banyana faced setbacks due to injuries, but they still posed threats, especially from Kgatlana. Unfortunately, they couldn't convert their chances, and a second Dutch goal diminished their momentum. Despite the defeat, Banyana Banyana returned home proud of their achievements.

In other news, the controversy surrounding the Russian cargo ship, Lady R, has seemingly been resolved. The ship did not carry South African weapons during its stop in Simon's Town Naval Base. Instead, it loaded food for its journey back to Russia. The ship had previously delivered an arms order for the SA National Defence Force from Russia. The investigation into this matter has been completed and is currently under review by President Cyril Ramaphosa. There have been concerns about whether the report findings will be made public due to national security concerns. However, discussions between the US and South Africa have been ongoing to mend relations after tensions were sparked by a statement from the US ambassador. The Lady R issue has now been cleared, and South Africa has been cleared of any wrongdoing.

In a career move, former Eskom chief, André de Ruyter, will be joining Yale University as a visiting senior fellow. He will focus on renewable energy and the green economy. De Ruyter's lectures will highlight Eskom's Just Energy Transition (JET) program, which has secured R150 billion for green projects. After taking a break following his departure from Eskom, De Ruyter aims to emphasize the importance of considering workers during the transition from coal. He will be teaching at Yale's School of Management, Jackson School of Global Affairs, and School of the Environment.

Lastly, in rugby, the South African Springbok team made a rousing comeback to secure a 24-13 victory over Argentina. This match was seen as a last chance for some players to qualify for the World Cup selection, and many of them delivered commendable performances. Canan Moodie stood out, while there are concerns over Lukhanyo Am's knee injury. Jean Kleyn, Damian Willemse, and Makazole Mapimpi also had outstanding performances. Manie Libbok faced some kicking issues but redeemed himself later. The team's overall play was decent, with moments of brilliance in the second half. The selection for the France World Cup remains uncertain for these players.

That's all for today's news. Thank you for joining us on 'Just a Moment News.' I'm Erika, and I'll see you next time.
