Hello, this is Erika, and you're listening to 'Just a Moment News' on this final day of 2023, the 31st of December. Let's dive into today's top stories.

First up, we have some exciting news from the world of cinema. The film 'Wonka' has made a triumphant return to the top of the box office, raking in an impressive $8.6 million and surpassing the $100 million mark in domestic earnings. This surge has knocked 'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom' down to the second spot. In the meantime, the animated comedy 'Migration' is holding steady at third place, while 'The Color Purple' and 'Anyone But You' round out the top five.

Moving on to the PDC World Darts Championship, where 16-year-old Luke Littler has made headlines by defeating five-time world champion Raymond van Barneveld. Littler's victory has earned him a spot in the quarter-finals, making him the youngest player to achieve this feat. In other matches, Brendan Dolan, Luke Humphries, and Scott Williams all secured their places in the next round, setting the stage for some thrilling quarter-final clashes.

Next, we turn to rugby, where the Stormers clinched a one-point victory against the Sharks. This win marked a fitting end to a remarkable year for South African rugby, serving as a reminder of the fine margins between victory and defeat. The Springboks, South Africa's national team, also had a successful year, winning all their World Cup play-off matches by a single point.

In other news, former McLaren team principal Ron Dennis has been knighted in the 2023 New Year's Honours List. Despite the significant milestone, McLaren has remained noticeably silent about the honor, reflecting the complex dynamics between Dennis and the current leadership. Despite this, Dennis's knighthood serves as a testament to his significant impact on McLaren and Formula 1.

As we bid farewell to 2023, Cape Town is gearing up for a variety of New Year's Eve celebrations. From theatrical performances and parties at the Baxter Theatre to a fireworks display at the V&A Waterfront, the city is set to welcome 2024 in style. Other notable events include a luxurious dinner at the Grand Africa Beach & Café and a silent disco at The Lawns CT in Camps Bay.

Finally, we have the story of Joe Kiani, CEO of Masimo, who has invested a significant sum in a legal battle against Apple. Kiani accuses Apple of patent infringement related to Masimo's blood-oxygen measurement technology. Despite the risk and financial strain, Kiani is determined to stand his ground, hoping to inspire a change in the industry's dynamics.

That's all the news for today. This is Erika, signing off from 'Just a Moment News'. Here's to a happy and prosperous 2024!
