### Transcript

Good morning, everyone! I'm Erika, and you're listening to "Just a Moment News" on August 9, 2023. Let's dive into today's headlines.

First up, we have the ongoing taxi strike in Cape Town, South Africa. The strikes, which are now on their sixth day, have caused significant concerns. Police Minister Bheki Cele is urging the Cape Town government and taxi operators to work together and find a resolution. The Minister of Transport, Sindisiwe Chikunga, has also called for the release of impounded taxis. Unfortunately, these strikes have resulted in five deaths, including a British national and a Cape Town LEAP officer. Additionally, ten buses were set on fire, and there have been numerous incidents of vandalism, looting, and violence. The UK has even issued a warning to its citizens about traveling to Cape Town due to the high-security threat. So far, 120 suspects have been arrested in connection with the violence. The city is refusing to negotiate unless the violence stops, which is affecting many, including children who cannot attend school. Minister Cele emphasizes the need for humility and cooperation, as it is the ordinary citizens, especially children, who are suffering the most from this situation.

Moving on, we have news from the world of rugby. South Africa's Rugby World Cup defense is facing challenges as three key players, Flyhalf Handre Pollard, centre Lukhanyo Am, and lock Lood de Jager, have been injured and excluded from the recently announced squad. However, these players are on standby in case of injuries during the tournament, which begins on September 8. Former Springbok captains, Jean de Villiers, John Smit, and Victor Matfield, have expressed their concerns over the squad selection. Smit highlighted the importance of goal-kickers, referencing the absence of Pollard, while Matfield praised the inclusion of 2019 World Cup-winning captain Siya Kolisi but voiced concerns about his match fitness. All former captains emphasized the significance of leadership roles, especially with the injuries to key players. The team's upcoming warm-up matches against Wales and New Zealand will provide insight into the potential starting lineup for the World Cup game against Scotland. The World Cup itself will feature matches against Romania, Ireland, and Tonga, with group winners and runners-up advancing to the knockout stage.

Next, we have an exciting development from Netflix. The streaming giant has launched a new app called "Netflix Game Controller," allowing subscribers to play games on their TV. The app transforms a user's phone into a controller once paired with their TV. While the specific games and release dates have not been officially announced, Netflix has hinted at games "Coming soon to Netflix" in the app description. Netflix's VP of Gaming, Mike Verdu, has previously discussed the company's plans for a cloud gaming expansion, emphasizing that they are not trying to replace consoles like PlayStation or Xbox but rather provide an additional value to their subscribers. Netflix has already ventured into mobile gaming, with over 50 titles launched so far. They have 40 games scheduled for release this year, with 16 being produced in-house and another 70 in collaboration with partners. It's worth mentioning that Netflix's recent efforts to prevent password sharing have been effective, and their global subscriber count now stands at 238.4 million.

In other tech news, Spotify has expanded its AI-powered DJ feature globally. Initially limited to users in the US, UK, Canada, and Ireland, the feature is now available to Spotify Premium users worldwide. This AI DJ feature aims to provide more engaging and personalized music recommendations by utilizing Spotify's algorithms, generative AI, and a voice model based on Xavier Jernigan, Spotify's Head of Cultural Partnerships. Users can access this feature through Spotify's Android or iOS app. The AI DJ, known as Xavier or X, curates music based on individual user preferences, occasionally introducing unfamiliar songs or revisiting less-listened tracks from favorite artists.

Lastly, we have news from Cape Town again, but this time it's a heartwarming story. In response to the ongoing taxi strikes, a restaurant at the V&A Waterfront has taken measures to ensure the safety and ability to work for its staff. The restaurant has accommodated its employees in a nearby hotel, allowing them to continue working without worry. The strikes, which began on August 3, have disrupted various businesses and services across the city, forcing many to either close or shorten their operational hours. This initiative by the Belgian restaurant highlights the importance of finding innovative solutions to continue operations during challenging times.

And that's it for today's headlines. Don't forget to look up to the skies this weekend, as the Perseid meteor shower is predicted to illuminate the Southern Hemisphere. If you're interested, there's even a "Star party" happening at the Cederberg Observatory on Saturday evening. Thanks for tuning in to "Just a Moment News." I'm Erika, and I'll be back tomorrow with more news updates. Have a great day!
