Good morning, and welcome to Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and today is November 19th, 2023. Let's dive into today's headlines.

First up, OpenAI's board is in talks with Sam Altman, the recently fired CEO, to potentially bring him back. Altman, who was let go due to communication issues with the board, is considering a return but has demanded significant changes in company operations. This unexpected firing has sparked criticism from the tech community and even led to the resignation of OpenAI President Greg Brockman. Altman and Brockman are also exploring the possibility of starting a new AI company with investor support. The situation is still evolving, so we'll keep an eye on any further developments.

In sports news, the Cricket World Cup final is set to take place in Ahmedabad, India, with India facing off against Australia. India, who has remained unbeaten throughout the tournament, is aiming for their third World Cup title and their first since 2011. The atmosphere in India is electric, with fans passionately supporting their team. Australia, although not India's primary rival, still brings a charged atmosphere to the match. Key players like Virat Kohli for India and David Warner for Australia are expected to play pivotal roles. The outcome of this final remains unpredictable, but it promises to be a historic event.

Moving on to Formula One, Charles Leclerc will start from pole position at the Las Vegas Grand Prix. His teammate Carlos Sainz, who initially qualified second, will receive a ten-place penalty due to a car issue during practice. This opens up an opportunity for Max Verstappen to start in the second position. The qualifying day went smoothly after a chaotic opening day of practice, and several drivers delivered impressive performances. The race is shaping up to be an exciting one.

In space news, SpaceX's Starship made significant progress in its recent test flight, despite not reaching its intended orbit. The test, conducted in South Texas, showcased key functionalities of the rocket, including hot staging and engine separation. Although the rocket exploded over the Gulf of Mexico, valuable data was gathered for further development. SpaceX's innovative and rapid testing approach is seen as a step forward in their ambitions, including Mars settlement and NASA's lunar missions.

In soccer news, Bafana Bafana, the South African national team, secured a 2-1 victory over Benin in their quest for qualification in the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Percy Tau made an immediate impact by scoring the opening goal just two minutes into the match. Khuliso Mudau doubled South Africa's advantage, and Steve Mounie scored a goal for Benin, but it wasn't enough to secure a draw. Bafana Bafana now holds the pole position in Group C.

Lastly, "The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes" had a modest opening at the box office, earning $19.1 million on Friday. It is projected to make between $44 million and $46 million for the weekend, falling short of the expected $50 million. The film's unique financial structure, funded mostly by foreign sales and German tax credits, sets it apart from other big-budget films. The reception to the film has been mixed, with a CinemaScore of B+ and higher ratings among younger female audiences. Its long-term performance and the viability of continuing the "Hunger Games" franchise remain uncertain.

That's all for today's news. Stay tuned for more updates. I'm Erika, and this is Just a Moment News. Have a great day!
