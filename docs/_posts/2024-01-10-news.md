Hello, everyone. This is Erika from 'Just a Moment News', bringing you the latest updates on this fine day of January 10, 2024. Let's dive right in.

First up, the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2024 has just wrapped up and it was a gadget lover's dream. The event showcased a wide array of innovative products, from a facial recognition security lock by Lockly to a high-capacity portable power station by Anker. There were also some fascinating gadgets for home use like the Exobrew Craft Gen 3 Pro+, a home beer brewing system, and the Pawwby P1 Ultra, a robotic cat litter box. The show highlighted the continuous advancements in consumer technology, not just from big tech companies but also from smaller startups.

Next, fans of sci-fi and "Game of Thrones" creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss have a lot to look forward to. They're teaming up with Alexander Woo to adapt the Chinese sci-fi trilogy "The Three-Body Problem" for Netflix. The series, titled "3 Body Problem", is set to premiere on March 21st, 2024. The new trailer promises an epic scope and a stellar cast. It's eagerly anticipated, given the popularity of Liu Cixin's books and the success of related Chinese blockbusters.

In other news, millionaire tech mogul Bryan Johnson has launched Project Blueprint, a 90-day "Self-Experimentation Study" focused on anti-aging. Participants can join for a fee and the program includes a strict diet with 67 interventions, including a Longevity drink mix and Johnson's signature Nutty Pudding Mix. However, longevity expert Dr. Andrew Steele has raised some concerns over the effectiveness and safety of some ingredients in the Blueprint products.

In the entertainment world, Tom Cruise is partnering with Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. to develop new film franchises. This comes after a long-running relationship with Paramount, where he starred in and produced the Top Gun and Mission Impossible films. Cruise will have an office on the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, California.

"Star Wars" fans, get ready for a new movie titled "The Mandalorian & Grogu," directed by Jon Favreau. The film, which will go into production later this year, will bring the beloved characters from the Disney+ series "The Mandalorian" to the big screen. The film's place in the timeline of the live-action series is yet to be clarified.

Over in Johannesburg, Mayor Kabelo Gwamanda has been criticized for repeatedly cancelling meetings with the Johannesburg Water Crisis Committee, who are trying to address the city's severe water outages. The committee has been offering their services free of charge, and despite the mayor's spokesperson stating Gwamanda's commitment to finding a solution, the meetings continue to be cancelled.

Lastly, an intriguing story has emerged about an antique bustle dress from the 1800s. The dress, purchased by archaeologist Sara Rivers Cofield, contained a hidden pocket with a cryptic note. After much speculation and detective work, the note was decoded by Wayne Chan, a data analyst at the University of Manitoba, and found to be a condensed weather report used in 1888 for telegraphic communications in the United States and Canada.

That's all for now. I'm Erika, your host at 'Just a Moment News'. Thank you for tuning in and have a great day!
