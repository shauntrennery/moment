### Transcript

Hello there, I'm Erika, and welcome to the 'Just a Moment News' podcast on this 23rd day of March, 2024. Let's dive into the top news stories making headlines today.

First up, we have some sobering news from the British royal family. Catherine, Princess of Wales, has been diagnosed with cancer, which is a heavy blow for the family that's already dealing with the loss of Queen Elizabeth II, the departure of Prince Harry and Meghan, and the exile of Prince Andrew. King Charles III, who himself is undergoing cancer treatment, has expressed his pride and support for Catherine, with the family hoping for privacy and peace during this challenging time. Harry and Meghan, who are now residing in Southern California, also wished health and healing for Kate and the family.

Moving on to a breakthrough in a cold case murder from 1980. Barbara Tucker, a nineteen-year-old student in Oregon, was brutally murdered and the case remained unsolved for over four decades. However, recent advances in DNA technology led to the conviction of Robert Plympton, a sixty-year-old man, based on DNA evidence found on a piece of discarded chewing gum. The case underscores the power of genetic genealogy in solving cold cases and the persistent efforts of law enforcement.

In sports news, Daniel Ricciardo, a Formula 1 driver, faced a setback at the Australian Grand Prix at Albert Park. His lap time was disqualified for exceeding track limits, placing him 18th out of 19 for the start of Sunday's race. This was particularly disappointing as it was his home grand prix. However, there's a glimmer of hope for Australian fans as Oscar Piastri of McLaren qualified sixth, suggesting a possibility for an Australian to reach the podium in Melbourne.

Next, we have some exciting news from the aviation industry. Boom Supersonic's XB-1 prototype has successfully completed its initial test flight. The company aims to revive supersonic commercial air travel with the Overture, a larger commercial supersonic aircraft. Despite the delay in flight tests, this marks a significant milestone in the company's journey towards faster-than-sound commercial flights.

In the world of football, a row has erupted over the German Football Association's decision to replace Adidas with Nike as the supplier for the national football team's kit. Critics argue that this change undermines a longstanding tradition, while the DFB justifies its decision by emphasizing the financial necessity of the deal with Nike. This controversy brings to light the broader discussions on the commercialization of sports and national symbols.

In the realm of podcasting, Spotify has launched a new feature that allows the public to see the popularity of podcasters by revealing the number of followers a show has on its platform. Joe Rogan's show, for example, has 14.5 million followers on Spotify. In addition, BandLab, a music creation and distribution app, has surpassed 100 million users, reflecting the growing trend of artists using digital platforms to produce, share, and monetize their music.

Finally, Jerry Seinfeld, the comedian known for his eponymous sitcom, has reached billionaire status, largely due to the enduring success of "Seinfeld." Despite disputes over the exact figures, this achievement underscores the immense profitability of his career in entertainment.

That's all for today's episode of 'Just a Moment News.' I'm Erika, and thank you for tuning in. Stay informed and see you next time.
