Good morning, and welcome to Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and here are the headlines for today, August 22, 2023.

First up, the Springboks, South Africa's rugby team, have made several changes for their upcoming test against the All Blacks. Despite returning from a knee injury, captain Siya Kolisi will be starting in the match. The team's head coach, Jacques Nienaber, expressed satisfaction with the team's development and sees this match as essential preparation before the Rugby World Cup in France. The match is scheduled for Friday, August 25, at Twickenham, London.

In other news, 18-year-old Indian chess prodigy Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa, also known as Pragg, is set to compete against five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen for the World Chess Champion title. Pragg has already defeated Carlsen in an online rapid chess tournament and has been praised by figures like Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Sachin Tendulkar. Despite his successes, Pragg remains humble about his achievements.

Moving on, the sci-fi TV series "Invasion" is ramping up the tension in its second season. After a slow start in the first season, season 2 starts more dynamically, following a global cast of characters dealing with the alien invasion with increased purpose and intensity. The season introduces new aliens and mysterious creatures, fulfilling the promises laid out in the first season and unfolding an epic tale.

Next, South African filmmaker Dan Mace and YouTube star MrBeast have raised over R1 million for Baphumelele Children's Home in Cape Town. Their collaboration included rebuilding an orphanage, donating 20,000 pairs of shoes, and various other heartwarming initiatives. This partnership showcases the positive change and impact that can be achieved through collaboration and compassion.

In sports, the Cape Town Formula E-Prix has been awarded the 'Race of the Year' at the e-Formula Season Awards 2023. The event, which took place in February, marked the first-ever Formula E race on African soil. The race saw 22 cars racing through renowned city landmarks at high speeds and had a significant economic impact on the city.

Lastly, India's Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft is set to attempt a landing on the lunar south pole on August 23. This mission, India's second attempt to land on the moon's south pole, could mark a historic achievement as the region is believed to contain water ice, crucial for future settlement. The mission has attracted attention for its cost-effectiveness and could boost India's reputation in space exploration.

That's all for today's headlines. Thank you for joining us on Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and I'll see you next time.
