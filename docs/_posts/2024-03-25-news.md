### Transcript

Hello everyone, this is Erika, and welcome to the 'Just a Moment News' podcast for March 25, 2024. Let's dive into the top stories making headlines today.

First up, we have an inspiring story from South Africa, where an outpouring of community support has been rallied for a six-week-old baby named Brayden. Brayden was born with a severe congenital diaphragmatic hernia, a condition that left him with a mere 15% chance of survival. However, thanks to a medical procedure in Belgium, his chances have been boosted to between 40 and 50%. The medical expenses have been a significant strain on Brayden's parents, Travis and Kylie Basson, with the NICU bill alone amounting to over a million Rand. But the South African community has shown incredible generosity, raising over half a million Rand to help cover the costs. This story really highlights the power of collective action in supporting those facing medical and financial hardships.

In sports news, South African athletes have been making a name for themselves at the 13th African Games in Accra, Ghana. Athletes like Rogail Joseph and Ashley Erasmus have secured gold medals in their respective events, while the nation as a whole has secured a total of 106 medals by March 23, making South Africa third on the medal table. It's been a momentous occasion for the nation’s athletes, and a testament to their hard work and dedication.

In the world of rugby, the United Rugby Championship (URC) has seen some impressive performances from South African teams. The Sharks secured their second win of the season against Irish club Ulster, while the Lions triumphed over Connacht even while being a player down. The Stormers and the Bulls also had their moments of glory, which has led to a strong phase for South African clubs in the URC, with all of them positioned within the top eight after twelve rounds.

On the Formula 1 circuit, George Russell had a terrifying crash at the Australian Grand Prix. Despite his car being stranded in the middle of the track, Russell was unharmed. However, the incident has sparked discussions about race safety protocols and the decision-making process regarding the deployment of red flags versus Virtual Safety Cars. 

Turning to tech news, the upcoming iOS 18 promises to enhance iPhone users' ability to customize their Home Screen app icon arrangements. This marks a significant shift from the current design and is expected to be unveiled at Apple's WWDC in June. The update also reportedly includes generative AI enhancements for Siri and various design updates, showing Apple's ongoing commitment to enhancing user experience and device personalization.

In a rather unusual story, a yogurt heist in the US has highlighted how cyber gangs are hijacking goods. Fraudsters impersonated a legitimate logistics company and misdirected a shipment worth about fifty thousand dollars of yogurt and plant-based milk. This incident is part of a broader issue of double brokering and outright theft, which has been detrimental across the logistics sector, leading to estimated losses of at least five hundred million dollars last year.

Finally, in entertainment news, "Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire" made a strong debut at the North American box office, securing $45.2 million from 4,345 theaters. However, the film's financial success remains uncertain given its production cost and the mixed reviews it has received. Other films like "Immaculate", "Dune: Part Two", and "Late Night With the Devil" also had varied performances, underscoring the diverse strategies and challenges in attracting audiences.

That wraps up our news roundup for today. Thanks for joining me, Erika, on 'Just a Moment News'. Stay informed and we'll catch you next time.
