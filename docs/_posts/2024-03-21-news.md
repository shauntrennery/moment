Good day listeners, this is Erika, and you're tuned in to 'Just a Moment News' on this beautiful day of March 21, 2024. Let's dive into today's top stories.

First up, we have an ongoing investigation by the Hawks, South Africa's Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, into the son-in-law of Deputy President Paul Mashatile, Nceba Nonkwelo. The focus is on the origin of funds used to purchase a luxury home in Constantia, Cape Town, valued at a whopping R28.9 million. This investigation is part of a broader inquiry into allegations of corruption and financial misconduct involving Mashatile and his immediate family. The purchase of the Constantia property, settled in cash and without a bond, has raised eyebrows and led to further scrutiny into Nonkwelo's financial dealings.

In the world of technology, Elon Musk's Neuralink is pushing boundaries. The company is working on brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that could allow humans to control devices through thought alone. After conducting trials on animals, Neuralink is now moving to human trials. The ultimate vision is to integrate BCIs into broader applications, such as thought-controlled self-driving vehicles. However, this also raises ethical and societal questions regarding privacy, autonomy, and the nature of human-machine integration.

Moving on, speculation is rife about the release of OpenAI's GPT-5, which could be unveiled in mid-2024. OpenAI's GPT-4, launched in March 2023, marked a significant advancement in AI language models. GPT-5 is expected to have enhanced predictive abilities and improvements in generalization and reduction of inaccuracies. This could have significant implications for various domains, including conversational interfaces like ChatGPT.

On the privacy front, it's been revealed that some of the most popular websites share user data with over 1,500 companies. This disclosure has come about following updates to the IAB Europe's Transparency and Consent Framework in response to GDPR compliance issues. While the move towards transparency is a positive step, the sheer number of companies involved in data sharing can be overwhelming for users, making informed decisions difficult.

In sports news, Liverpool Football Club is betting on AI to improve its success from corner kicks. The club has turned to DeepMind's TacticAI, an AI system that offers tailored advice on executing corner kicks. Trained on thousands of corner kicks from Premier League matches, TacticAI utilizes geometric deep learning to analyze and recommend player positioning and ball delivery strategies.

Finally, "Game of Thrones" creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss have embarked on a new project, "3 Body Problem," based on the celebrated science-fiction saga by Liu Cixin. The series premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival and was released on Netflix. The creators have brought a unique blend of science, history, and intrigue to the screen, with the series exploring themes of faith and belief in the context of an alien invasion.

That's all for today's news. This is Erika, signing off from 'Just a Moment News'. Stay informed and have a great day!
