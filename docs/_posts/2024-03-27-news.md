### Transcript

Hello everyone, this is Erika from 'Just a Moment News', bringing you the top stories for today, March 27, 2024. 

First up, we have a story from the South African Parliament. Acting Speaker Lechesa Tsenoli recently reprimanded several members, including deputy ministers, parliamentary committee chairpersons, and the president of the ANC Youth League, for failing to disclose their financial interests for 2023 by the given deadline. The reasons for their tardiness varied from load-shedding and IT issues to family emergencies and car accidents. Due to this non-compliance, Tsenoli has criticized these actions as detrimental to public trust in parliament. The ethics committee has recommended fines and public reprimands for the offending MPs, emphasizing the need for discipline and transparency in the House.

Next, we turn to the corporate sector where Nampak, a leading packaging company in South Africa, has experienced a significant data breach in its IT systems. Despite the company's robust security measures, unauthorized activity by an unidentified third party led to the breach. Nampak is currently working with cybersecurity experts to determine the extent of the breach and to restore system integrity. The company has switched to manual controls to ensure that manufacturing and operations remain unaffected. They have also communicated their compliance with the Protection of Personal Information Act, promising to notify potentially impacted individuals in line with legal requirements.

Moving on to a maritime incident, investigators are examining whether contaminated fuel played a role in a Baltimore bridge crash. The cargo ship, the Dali, lost power and crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge, and investigators are exploring the possibility that this power failure was due to contaminated fuel. The National Transportation Safety Board is leading the inquiry, reviewing vessel operation and safety records. The incident could potentially lead to extensive insurance claims, highlighting the complexity of maritime operations and the importance of maintaining ship functionality.

In tech news, Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference for 2024 is expected to be a platform for both software innovations and potential hardware unveilings. Rumors suggest that iOS 18 will prominently feature generative AI integration, offering a revamped Siri and novel AI functionalities across Apple's suite of applications. The conference is also expected to reveal Apple's AI strategy, potentially introducing an AI App Store and emphasizing on-device AI processing.

In the realm of space exploration, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory is developing a snake robot for extraterrestrial exploration. The Exobiology Extant Life Surveyor (EELS), a snake robot, is being designed for the exploration of Enceladus, one of Saturn's moons. The robot is being tested in environments on Earth that mimic the icy conditions of Enceladus, with plans to explore the moon's subsurface oceans.

Next, an archaeological discovery in Utrecht has revealed a first-century Common Era bone container filled with black henbane seeds. The seeds, used in ancient times for medicinal purposes, were found among 86,000 bones near a farm. The discovery provides insight into ancient medical practices and the understanding of plant-based treatments in Roman society.

Finally, in lottery news, two massive jackpots are up for grabs this week in Powerball and Mega Millions drawings. A Mega Millions ticket sold in New Jersey has claimed an estimated $1.13 billion jackpot. Meanwhile, the Powerball game offers a potential $865 million jackpot, following thirty-six consecutive draws without a grand prize winner.

That's all for today's headlines. This is Erika, signing off from 'Just a Moment News'. Stay informed and have a great day!
