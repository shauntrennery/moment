Hello, everyone! This is Erika and you're listening to 'Just a Moment News' on this beautiful day of March 20, 2024. Let's dive into our top stories for the day.

First up, we have a critical mission underway in the waters off the coast of Africa. The Orange Marine's Léon Thévenin ship has set sail to repair four important undersea cables near Cote d’Ivoire that broke last week. This incident has caused widespread internet outages across several African countries. The ship, equipped with all the necessary repair tools and fibre optic cable, is expected to reach Abidjan by the end of March. Meanwhile, another repair ship, the CS Sovereign, remains in England. The repair efforts are estimated to take three to five weeks, so we're looking at potential restoration around early to mid-April 2024.

Moving on to tech news, Nvidia has unveiled its most powerful single-chip GPU to date, the Blackwell B200 tensor core chip. This chip is designed to drastically reduce the operating costs and energy consumption of AI inference processes. Alongside this, Nvidia announced the GB200 "superchip," which integrates two B200 chips and a Grace CPU for enhanced performance. This launch is part of Nvidia's strategy to cater to the increasing computational demands of AI models.

In the automotive sector, South African consumer preferences showed a significant inclination towards SUVs in 2023. Toyota emerged as a dominant player, with the Toyota Fortuner leading as the top-selling used SUV. Other popular body types included hatchbacks and double-cab bakkies, with the Volkswagen Polo and Ford Ranger leading their respective categories. The data reveals a shift in consumer preferences towards more affordable options.

In royal news, Catherine, Princess of Wales, has been under scrutiny following the digital alteration of a photograph featuring her and her children. This incident has intensified debates over the royal family's communication strategies and placed Catherine under greater public scrutiny. The tension between public interest and privacy, as well as the role of digital media in shaping perceptions of public figures, is clearly evident here.

In entertainment news, Trevor Noah, a renowned comedian and political commentator, is exploring real estate options in New York City's West Village after selling his Hell’s Kitchen penthouse. His interest in NYC's market led him to view a unit in The Shephard, a luxury building that houses celebrities like Jason Biggs and Stephanie March. The unit Noah toured is listed at a cool $7.4 million.

In the world of sports, legendary boxer Mike Tyson has significantly changed his financial demands for a comeback fight against social media star Jake Paul. Initially demanding a billion dollars, Tyson has agreed to a much lower purse for the event. The fight is scheduled for July 20 at AT&T Stadium in Texas and will be streamed on Netflix.

Finally, Google DeepMind, in collaboration with Liverpool Premier League club, has created a prototype AI football tactician named TacticAI. This project focuses on enhancing football strategies, particularly during corner kicks. The technology, developed over three years of collaboration with Liverpool, employs geometric deep learning to analyze thousands of corner kicks. 

That's all for today's stories. This is Erika, signing off from 'Just a Moment News'. Stay informed, stay safe, and have a great day!
