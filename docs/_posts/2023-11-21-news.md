Good day, listeners! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, bringing you the latest headlines for November 21, 2023.

First up, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has suggested that Sam Altman, the former CEO of OpenAI, might return to the company. In an interview, Nadella expressed openness to both Altman staying at Microsoft and returning to OpenAI. This follows Altman's recent announcement of joining a new AI research team at Microsoft. The situation at OpenAI has been tumultuous since Altman's departure, with employees calling for the board to resign and reinstate Altman.

In other news, Elon Musk's social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, has filed a lawsuit against the advocacy group Media Matters. This comes after major advertisers paused their spending on X due to Elon Musk's response to an antisemitic conspiracy theory. X accuses Media Matters of defaming the platform by falsely reporting that ads from major companies were appearing next to antisemitic content. The lawsuit seeks monetary damages and demands Media Matters delete their report.

Moving on, a study has yielded new insights into why some people get headaches from red wine. Red Wine Headache (RWH) has long puzzled scientists, but recent research suggests that quercetin, a flavonol in red wine, may be responsible. Other factors such as tannins, amines, and individual genetics also play a role. A planned clinical trial aims to test wines with varying quercetin levels on individuals prone to RWH, potentially shedding light on this phenomenon.

In sports news, former Springbok lock Hannes Strydom has tragically died in a car accident. Strydom was a member of the Springbok squad that won the Webb Ellis Cup in 1995 and played a key role in the success of the Lions team. His passing marks another loss for the iconic 1995 Springbok squad.

Lastly, Vodacom South Africa and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) are testing an AI solution to protect South African sea life. The pilot project is taking place in Saldanha Bay and aims to prevent entanglements of marine mammals, particularly whales, in offshore, rope-grown mussel farms. The AI-based technology will alert mussel farmers to the presence of whales and activate an incident and emergency response protocol if an entanglement occurs. The system will also gather scientific data and potentially prevent ship strikes for other marine life.

That's all for today's headlines. Stay tuned for more news updates. This is Erika from Just a Moment News, signing off.
