Good morning, everyone! This is Erika from Just a Moment News, and today is November 11th, 2023. Let's dive into today's news stories.

First up, we have some exciting news from the Cricket World Cup. South Africa secured a spot in the semi-finals by defeating Afghanistan. Despite facing some challenges during the run-chase, South Africa emerged victorious with a five-wicket win. Rassie van der Dussen and Andile Phehlukwayo played crucial roles in leading the team to victory. However, South Africa's bowling performance remains a concern as they allowed Afghanistan to recover and score 244 runs. Captain Temba Bavuma, despite a hamstring injury, chose to stay on the field, showcasing his leadership. The team now looks ahead to their crucial semi-final match against Australia at Eden Gardens.

Next, we have news from the MTN Business App of the Year awards. Kena Health, a health start-up, was recognized as the overall App of the Year 2023 and the Best Health Solution. This app aims to revolutionize healthcare accessibility in South Africa and beyond by offering affordable virtual consultations. The event also honored winners in other categories, including Discovery Bank for Best Consumer Solution and Medsol Breast AI for Best Enterprise Solution. The awards highlighted the transformative impact of technology in various fields and its role in addressing critical societal issues.

Moving on, Clickatell, a South African company specializing in chat commerce, has launched new AI tools to enhance personalized conversations in customer interactions. These tools use natural language processing and generative AI to provide businesses with AI-generated responses for their agents. Clickatell's AI is adaptable across various sectors and aims to improve customer engagement, reduce manual programming efforts, and increase conversions and revenue. For consumers, this AI ensures quicker and more accurate responses, enhancing the overall shopping experience.

Shifting gears, let's talk about the Rugby World Cup Spend Trends. Discovery Bank has shared insights into how the Rugby World Cup impacted the spending habits of its clients. The report revealed that flights booked from South Africa to the United Kingdom increased by 66%, as fans tried to make their way to France to watch the Springboks. There was also a significant increase in flights booked from South Africa to France compared to the previous year. Additionally, clients supported the Bokke by increasing their spend on every day South Africa played. After the final match, spend among clients in South Africa increased threefold compared to any other average Saturday night during the year.

Lastly, we have news from the Foschini Group (TFG). TFG's online sales now make up almost 10% of the retail group's turnover, more than double the market average. The group's online retail turnover rose 23.9% year on year, contributing 9.8% of the total turnover. TFG attributed this growth to a strong performance by its South African businesses. Despite tough economic conditions, TFG lifted its group revenue by 12.9% and declared an interim dividend of 1 rand 50 per share.

And that's all for today's news stories. Stay tuned for more updates. This is Erika from Just a Moment News, signing off. Have a great day!
