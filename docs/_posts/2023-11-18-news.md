Good day, I'm Erika from Just a Moment News, and here are today's headlines for November 18, 2023:

First, OpenAI, the artificial intelligence research lab, has fired Sam Altman, one of its board members. Altman, who was in the process of raising funds for a new venture capital fund, stepped down as CEO of OpenAI. The board cited a loss of confidence in Altman's leadership abilities, stating that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board. Altman's business dealings had been a subject of intrigue in Silicon Valley, with questions raised about his network of investments. Mira Murati, OpenAI's chief technology officer, will serve as interim CEO, and the company plans to begin a search for a permanent CEO soon.

In other news, the first voter registration weekend is set to begin in South Africa. The Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) has released guidelines for the 2024 national and provincial elections. Eligible voters can register online on the IEC website or visit local IEC offices to inspect the voters' roll. It is important for eligible voters to update their details, such as address or ID number, if there have been any changes. The registration stations will be open from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm on both days.

Moving on, Germany will lend South Africa R10 billion to support its shift to renewable energy. The loan, provided by Germany's KfW development bank, is part of the Just Energy Transition Partnership and aims to help South Africa transition away from coal-fired electricity. The loan will support the implementation of reform measures to address the energy crisis in South Africa and contribute to a sustainable restructuring of the energy sector. The agreement is seen as a prototype for similar agreements with other countries.

Next, Trevor Noah, the comedian and former host of The Daily Show, is set to release a new Netflix special titled "Where Was I" on December 19. This will be Noah's fourth special with Netflix, and it features him recounting humorous experiences from his travels. In addition to his Netflix endeavors, Noah has also launched a podcast called "What Now? With Trevor Noah" on Spotify. He is currently on a global stand-up tour called the Off the Record Tour.

Lastly, Vodacom, a mobile network operator in South Africa, is conducting a pilot project using artificial intelligence to optimize its mobile network configurations. In collaboration with Nvidia, Vodacom has created a virtual network management platform that simulates network equipment configurations in real time. The system aims to improve network performance and reduce power costs and maintenance hours. However, human oversight is still required, and the high cost of computation limits the expansion of the system to other countries where Vodacom operates.

That's all for today's news. Join us again tomorrow for more updates. I'm Erika from Just a Moment News. Have a great day!
