Good day, and welcome to Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and today is August 8th, 2023. Let's dive into today's headlines.

In Cape Town, taxi-related violence has escalated, leading to tense negotiations between the city and the South African National Taxi Council (Santaco). Cape Town Mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis has criticized the taxi industry for reneging on previously agreed terms and causing further violence. The Golden Arrow Bus Services (GABS) had to obtain a court interdict after its buses were targeted. The city has since obtained an interdict against Santaco's strike, preventing blockade of public roads and interference with transport depots. Despite Santaco distancing itself from the violent incidents, the city has held firm, arresting 44 people for public violence and shutting down 27 schools due to the unrest. Further discussions with Transport Minister Sindisiwe Chikunga are set to take place... 

Moving on, popular YouTuber and entrepreneur MrBeast, also known as Jimmy Donaldson, is facing a $100 million lawsuit filed by Virtual Dining Concepts (VDC), the company handling his virtual burger chain, MrBeast Burger.

Paxos will provide regular reports and third-party attestations regarding the assets backing PYUSD. However, PayPal's shares saw a 7% drop in extended trading after missing its projected quarterly operating margin...

South African restaurant group Spur has reported an 83% surge in full-year profits. The increase is attributed to an increased preference for dining out amid frequent load shedding in the country. Spur owns various chains, including RocoMamas, Hussar Grill, Panarottis, and John Dory's. Franchised restaurant sales climbed almost a quarter, with an uptick in patronage from both the top and low ends of the market. However, the middle-income segment venues experienced more moderate performance, reflecting economic pressure on the middle class. Despite challenges such as rising interest rates and inflation, Spur outperformed in its core steakhouse brand and premium specialty restaurants. The company's marketing efforts also led to a 13% rise in foot traffic...
