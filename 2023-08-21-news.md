### Transcript

Good morning, and welcome to Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and today is August 21, 2023. Let's dive into today's headlines.

First up, President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa addressed the nation on the country's foreign policy and the upcoming BRICS Summit. South Africa is set to host the 15th BRICS Summit from August 22 to 24 in Sandton, Gauteng. The summit aims to address inclusive economic recovery, sustainable development, strengthening ties with Africa, and fostering progressive multilateralism. Alongside the Heads of State Summit, South Africa will also host the 9th BRICS Parliamentary Forum Assembly in September 2023. The discussions are expected to have a positive global impact and emphasize the importance of cooperation and inclusive prosperity.

Next, we have news about Hurricane Hilary. The storm has been barreling toward Mexico and California. After making landfall on Mexico's Baja California coast, it crossed into the U.S., affecting San Diego County and Los Angeles. The storm brought strong winds, heavy rain, and the potential for catastrophic flooding. Schools were closed, and Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in 11 counties. In Mexico, one death and minor damage were reported. The National Hurricane Center issued the first-ever tropical storm warning for Southern California.

Moving on, Spain emerged victorious in the Women's World Cup, defeating England with a score of 1-0. Olga Carmona scored the decisive goal in the first half, securing Spain's first women's world title. This victory also makes Spain the first nation to win both the women's and men's World Cups. Despite England's efforts, Spain dominated possession and maintained control throughout the match. The game took place in Sydney, and Spain lifted the trophy at Stadium Australia.

In other news, convicted fraudsters Rodney Mitchell and Peter Gardener, previously jailed for fraud with Leisurenet (owner of Health & Racquet Club), have been profiting from Virgin Active leases. The Health & Racquet Club, now owned by Virgin Active, had leases connected to Mitchell and Gardener. These individuals allegedly have links to companies leasing properties to Virgin Active in Bedfordview and Cape Town. Virgin Active acknowledged the existing lease structures but declined to comment further.

Meta, the parent company of Facebook, is reportedly preparing to launch a web version of Threads, their Twitter competitor. The feature, missing since the service began, is in development along with enhanced search functionality. Threads has already surpassed 100 million users and has been steadily adding key features. The web version's release has been internally tested but requires further refinement before a public rollout.

Lastly, Russia's first moon mission in decades ended in failure after the spacecraft collided with the lunar surface. The Luna-25 mission lost communication with the spacecraft before the collision occurred. A special commission will investigate the reasons for the loss. This setback marks a disappointment for Russia's space ambitions, as the mission was meant to be their first lunar landing in 47 years.

And that wraps up today's news. Stay informed, stay curious, and have a great day. This is Erika from Just a Moment News, signing off.
