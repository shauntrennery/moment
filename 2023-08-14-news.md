### Transcript

Good day, and welcome to Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and here are today's headlines for August 14, 2023.

First up, Natasha Joubert has been crowned as the new Miss South Africa. The 26-year-old fashion designer from Gauteng won the title at the Sunbet Arena in Pretoria, beating out Nande Mabala and Bryoni Govender. This is Joubert's second time participating in the pageant, as she was the runner-up in 2020. She will now represent South Africa at the 2021 Miss Universe competition. Congratulations to Natasha Joubert on her well-deserved win!

Next, the anticipated cage match between Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk seems to be postponed indefinitely. Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, has expressed his belief that Musk, the owner of the platform formerly known as Twitter, is not genuinely interested in the proposed mixed martial arts fight. Despite Zuckerberg proposing a date and UFC president Dana White being prepared to make it an official match for charity, Musk has been evasive. This unexpected rivalry began when Musk initially challenged Zuckerberg to a "cage match" in June. It seems that the fight may not happen after all.

Moving on, Apple TV+ has announced a new docuseries focusing on Lionel Messi's journey as he moves to the U.S. to play for Major League Soccer's Inter Miami CF. The six-part documentary will provide an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at Messi's transition, following his two-decade-long career at Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain. The documentary will be available on the MLS Season Pass, a collaboration between Apple and Major League Soccer. Stay tuned for more details on this exciting project.

In unfortunate news, a young aspiring Formula One racer's dreams have been shattered due to financial disputes between his divorced parents. Both parents initially agreed to fund his racing passion, but disagreements arose after the father entered a new relationship. The father stipulated that he would only continue paying if the mother was civil about his new partner, which she refused. Legal battles ensued, and the court ultimately deemed that the teenager missing out on the remainder of the 2023 season would not cause irreparable harm. It's disheartening to see personal conflicts affecting a young person's dreams.

Lastly, Stellenbosch FC emerged victorious against SuperSport United in their MTN8 quarter-final clash. With a 1-0 scoreline in extra time, Andre de Jong's header secured the win for Stellenbosch FC. They will now face Orlando Pirates in the semi-finals, while Kaizer Chiefs will take on Mamelodi Sundowns. These matches promise to be intense, as all the teams involved have a history of strong competition. Despite the importance of the match, the Peter Mokaba Stadium had a lower turnout, and the game was characterized by missed opportunities and spells of dominant possession without fruitful results.

That's all for today's news. Thank you for joining me on Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and I'll see you next time.
