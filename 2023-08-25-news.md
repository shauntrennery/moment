Good day, and welcome to Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and here are today's headlines for August 25, 2023.

First up, former US President Donald Trump has surrendered at a Georgia jail. The Fulton County Jail went on hard lockdown as Trump arrived, amidst an ongoing DOJ investigation into its conditions. District Attorney Fani Willis gave Trump and 18 co-defendants until noon Friday to surrender. Trump's arraignment date is pending, where he's expected to plead not guilty and may seek a federal court move. He faces multiple criminal charges in Georgia and has also been indicted in New York, Florida, and Washington, D.C. This development has caused quite a scene outside the jail.

In sports news, Wayde van Niekerk, a South African sprinter, finished last in the 400m final at the World Championships in Budapest. Van Niekerk, who once held the world record in this event, failed to recapture his former glory with a time of 45.11 seconds. Jamaican Antonio Watson emerged as the winner of the race, followed by Great Britain's Matthew Hudson-Smith and Quincy Hall. The absence of key figures like reigning world champion Michael Norman and Olympic champion Steven Gardiner due to injuries made the race highly competitive. Van Niekerk's disappointing finish raises questions about his future in the sport, especially considering his struggles to regain form after a knee injury six years ago. Additionally, three South Africans in the 200m semi-finals also failed to advance, making it a challenging day for South African athletics.

Moving on to international news, Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant is releasing treated radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean. This decision comes after a buildup of 350 million gallons of contaminated water since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The water has been treated using a system called ALPS to remove most harmful isotopes, but tritium cannot be filtered out. To minimize risks, the water will be diluted with seawater and released slowly over several decades. While some believe this is the safest option, there are concerns and objections from nearby nations. China has suspended aquatic imports from Japan, and the decision has sparked protests in South Korea. Critics argue that alternative solutions should have been explored, and there are worries about the long-term impact on fisheries and the precedent it sets for other countries' disposal of nuclear waste.

In tech news, a rockfall in an undersea canyon has damaged fibre-optic cables, including the West Africa Cable System (Wacs), causing slow internet connections in South Africa. To address this issue, the 40-year-old cable-layer vessel Léon Thévenin has set sail to repair the damage. The repairs are expected to be completed in September, but the timeline is subject to variables such as weather conditions. Currently, all South African networks are experiencing disruptions due to the damaged cables.

Lastly, in rugby news, the upcoming Springbok game against the All Blacks is seen as preparation for a bigger clash with Scotland in the 2023 Rugby World Cup. Both Scotland and South Africa strategically chose their warmup opponents based on stylistic similarities. Scotland's coach, Gregor Townsend, has highlighted the likeness between their opponents, Georgia, and South Africa, referring to them as a "mini-Boks" due to their physicality and growing aspects of their game. Other teams like New Zealand, France, and Ireland are also selecting their final warmup matches based on stylistic comparisons to their World Cup opponents. This intense warmup phase puts all teams under pressure, particularly England and Australia, as they seek momentum leading into the World Cup. The Boks' showdown with the All Blacks is the weekend highlight, and Scotland is keenly observing both teams to better understand South Africa's improved and wider-playing strategy.

And that wraps up today's news. Thank you for joining us on Just a Moment News. I'm Erika, and I'll see you next time.
